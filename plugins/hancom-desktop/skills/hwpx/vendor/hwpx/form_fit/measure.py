"""Conservative text measurement for FormFit (plan §2 C, task 2).

Everything is in **HWPUNIT** (1 pt = 100 HWPUNIT, 1 inch = 7200 HWPUNIT). Crucially
font height *and* cell width share that unit, so a glyph's advance is just a
fraction of the font height (the "em") — no DPI/point conversion is needed.

The advance fractions below are **calibrated against a real Hancom-saved form**
(``work/formfit_calibrate.py`` over 1492 ``lineSegArray`` caches): full-width
Hangul/CJK is reliably 1.0 em; Latin/digit/space/punct are averaged and therefore
*approximate*. That approximation is the whole reason measurement reports a
**confidence** and the engine refuses to hard-fail a borderline case — Hancom (the
render oracle) is the only authority on the close calls (plan §1 "measure-first",
§2 C acceptance "measurement honesty over false precision").

    Checkboxes and similar form controls flow on the text line
    (``hp:pos/@treatAsChar='1'``) and consume their ``hp:sz/@width``; a fill
    value shares whatever width remains. Objects without a declared size are
    counted but contribute 0 width (the count still signals reduced trust).
